Tarkov Randomizer is a customizable loadout generator that you can use to determine your weapons and gear for you next Tarkov raid.

This project was made using React, Typescript, and Node.js.

It uses Github Actions to automatically run a scraper on the Escape From Tarkov wiki once a month that will get stored in the MySQL database to account for any new additions to the game.
